Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
It is designed to help developers create web applications quickly and efficiently, with a focus on reusability, less code, and the principle of "don't repeat yourself" (DRY).  
Django provides a robust set of features, including an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system, an admin interface, and built-in security features, making it a popular choice for building web applications.
