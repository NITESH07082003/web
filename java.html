    <pre>
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
It is a general-purpose programming language that is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another.
Java is used for building server-side applications, mobile applications (especially Android apps), and large-scale enterprise systems.
Java is known for its portability, scalability, and robustness, making it a popular choice for developers worldwide.
