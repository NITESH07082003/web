    <pre>
MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database program.
It is classified as a NoSQL database program and uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.
It is designed for scalability and flexibility, allowing developers to work with large volumes of data without the constraints of traditional relational databases.
MongoDB is widely used for building modern applications that require high performance, scalability, and flexibility in data storage.
