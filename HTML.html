HTML  ( HyperText Markup Language ) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
HTML describes the structure of a webpage semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. 
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. 
With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. 
HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
